# Benchmarks_PLP
Benchmarks, testbenches, and transformed codes by parametric loop pipelining (PLP) and runtime dependence analysis (RT-Dep)  

# Naming rule:  
XXX.c : benchmark loop  
XXX_vivado.c : transformed by PLP  
XXX_rt.c : transformed by RT-Dep  
XXX_test.c : testbench  

globals.h is the head file the codes transformed by RT-Dep
